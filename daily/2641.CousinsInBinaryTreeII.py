APPROACH: Breadth First Search or Depth First Search

INTUITION: To find the sum of a nodes cousins we need to main pieces of information: 1. the total sum of the nodes at that level and 2. the sum of the 
current node and its sibling (if it has one). With these two pieces of information, the sum of a nodes cousins simply entails subtracting the sum of
the siblings from the sum of the nodes at that level. To find the sum of the nodes at each level of the tree we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) or
a depth-first search (DFS), and the same goes for the reassignment of original node values to the sum of a node's cousins. This two pass approach intuitive
because the sum of the nodes at a level and the sum of a sibling pair at that same level are coupled values (i.e. you cannot get the sum of the nodes a 
a level, without calculating the sum of a pair of siblings on that level) that are conceptually easier to calculate in two separate processes. 

    ALGORITHM:
        - Initialize an empty or 0-filled list to store level sum values
        - Use DFS or BFS to traverse the tree and calculate the sum of nodes at each level (see LC 2583.)
        - Use DFS or BFS to traverse the tree again, calculate and reaasign node values to the sum of their cousins (see. dfs_valupdate() and second BFS
        pass in replaceValueInTree())
        - Return the modified tree

COMPLEXITY:
    TIME: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree
        - There are n nodes in the tree and we visit each one twice. Once for the first pass and once for the second pass.
        - This means that the overall time complexity is O(2*n), which simplifies to O(n) time
    SPACE: O(log(n))(!), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, and log(n) is the approximate number of levels in a well balanced tree
        - log(n) represents the approximate number of levels in a well balanced tree, which corresponds to the length of the auxilliary level_sums array
        as well as the maximum possible number of calls on the recursive call stack.
        - Therefore the space complexity is O(log(n))(!).
        - NOTE(!) The stated space complexity only holds if the binary tree is well balanced, if it is not, then in the worst case we would need O(n)
        auxilliary space to store the sum of nodes at each level, we could have up to n calls on the recursive call stack (takes O(n) space), and (in the case of BFS) the
        queue can grow to hold all nodes at once (takes O(n) space).
            - This would change the overall space complexity to O(3*n) which simplifies to O(n) space.
